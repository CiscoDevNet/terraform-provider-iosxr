# IOSXR Provider

The IOSXR provider provides resources to interact with one or more Cisco IOS-XR devices. The provider supports the **gNMI** (HTTP/2-based) protocol for device communication by default.

## Device Configuration

### gNMI (Default)

gNMI is the default protocol and requires the following device configuration:

```
grpc
```

All resources and data sources have been tested with the following releases.

| Platform   | Version |
| ---------- | ------- |
| XRv 9000   | 24.4.2  |
| XRd        | 24.4.2  |
| NCS 5500   | 24.4.2  |
| Cisco 8000 | 24.4.2  |

## Guides

The following guides are available to help you get started with the IOSXR provider:

- **[Manage Multiple Devices](guides/manage_multiple_devices)** - Learn how to manage multiple IOS-XR devices using provider aliases or the single-provider approach with device-level management control
- **[Selective Deploy](guides/selective_deploy)** - Deploy configurations to a subset of devices while keeping others in a "frozen" state for staged rollouts and maintenance scenarios
- **[Importing Resources](guides/importing_resources)** - Import existing device configurations into Terraform state management
- **[Destroying Resources](guides/destroying_resources)** - Control resource destruction behavior using delete modes
- **[Changelog](guides/changelog)** - Review version history and breaking changes

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "iosxr" {
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
  host     = "10.1.1.1"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `ca_certificate` (String) TLS CA certificate content. This can also be set as the IOSXR_CA_CERTIFICATE environment variable.
- `certificate` (String) TLS certificate content. This can also be set as the IOSXR_CERTIFICATE environment variable.
- `devices` (Attributes List) This can be used to manage a list of devices from a single provider. All devices must use the same credentials. Each resource and data source has an optional attribute named `device`, which can then select a device by its name from this list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--devices))
- `host` (String) IP or name of the Cisco IOS-XR device. Optionally a port can be added with `:12345`. The default port is `57400`. This can also be set as the IOSXR_HOST environment variable. If no `host` is provided, the `host` of the first device from the `devices` list is being used.
- `key` (String) TLS private key content. This can also be set as the IOSXR_KEY environment variable.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for the IOS-XR device. This can also be set as the IOSXR_PASSWORD environment variable.
- `reuse_connection` (Boolean) Reuse gNMI connection. This can also be set as the IOSXR_REUSE_CONNECTION environment variable. Defaults to `true`.
- `selected_devices` (List of String) This can be used to select a list of devices to manage from the `devices` list. Selected devices will be managed while other devices will be skipped and their state will be frozen. This can be used to deploy changes to a subset of devices. Defaults to all devices.
- `tls` (Boolean) Use TLS. This can also be set as the IOSXR_TLS environment variable. Defaults to `true`.
- `username` (String) Username for the IOS-XR device. This can also be set as the IOSXR_USERNAME environment variable.
- `verify_certificate` (Boolean) Verify target certificate. This can also be set as the IOSXR_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE environment variable. Defaults to `false`.

### Nested Schema for `devices`

Required:

- `host` (String) IP of the Cisco IOS-XR device.
- `name` (String) Device name.

Optional:

- `managed` (Boolean) Enable or disable device management. This can be used to temporarily skip a device due to maintenance for example. Defaults to `true`.
