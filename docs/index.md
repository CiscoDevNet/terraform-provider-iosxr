# IOSXR Provider

The IOSXR provider provides resources to interact with one or more Cisco IOS-XR devices.

It currently only supports unsecured (no TLS) gRPC connections with user/password authentication. The required device configuration can be found below.

```
grpc
 port 57400
 no-tls
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "iosxr" {
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
  host     = "10.1.1.1"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `devices` (Attributes List) This can be used to manage a list of devices from a single provider. All devices must use the same credentials. Each resource and data source has an optional attribute named `device`, which can then select a device by its name from this list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--devices))
- `host` (String) IP or name of the Cisco IOS-XR device. Optionally a port can be added with `:12345`. The default port is `57400`. This can also be set as the IOSXR_HOST environment variable. If no `host` is provided, the `host` of the first device from the `devices` list is being used.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for the IOS-XR device. This can also be set as the IOSXR_PASSWORD environment variable.
- `username` (String) Username for the IOS-XR device. This can also be set as the IOSXR_USERNAME environment variable.
