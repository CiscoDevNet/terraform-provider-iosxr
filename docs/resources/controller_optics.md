- `type` (String) Controller type
  - Choices: `Optics`

### Optional

- `breakout` (String) breakout mode configuration
- `delete_mode` (String) Configure behavior when deleting/destroying the resource. Either delete the entire object (YANG container) being managed, or only delete the individual resource attributes configured explicitly and leave everything else as-is. Default value is `all`.
  - Choices: `all`, `attributes`
- `description` (String) The description of this interface
- `device` (String) A device name from the provider configuration.
- `link_status` (Boolean) Enable interface and line-protocol state change alarms

- `shutdown` (Boolean) The existence of this configuration indicates the interface is shut down
- `speed` (String) optics speed set configuration
- `transceiver_disable` (Boolean) Disable the transceiver module, treating it as not inserted.  When the configuration is removed, the transceiver module on that port, if present, would be initialized as if it is just inserted

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import iosxr_controller_optics.example "<type>,<name>,<active>"
```
