# iosxr_mpls_ldp_mldp (Resource)

This resource can manage the MPLS LDP MLDP configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "iosxr_mpls_ldp_mldp" "example" {
  logging_notifications = true
  logging_internal      = true
  address_family = [
    {
      name = "ipv4"
      statics = [
        {
          lsp_address = "192.168.2.1"
          p2mp        = 5
        }
      ]
      make_before_break_delay        = 60
