# IOSXR Provider

The IOSXR provider provides resources to interact with one or more Cisco IOS-XR devices.

The required device configuration can be found below.

```
grpc
```

All resources and data sources have been tested with IOS-XR 7.6.1 release, and might not be supported with earlier versions due to relying on unified YANG Models which were only started to be introduced in IOS-XR release 7.0.1.
