# IOSXR Provider

The IOSXR provider provides resources to interact with one or more Cisco IOS-XR devices using gNMI or NETCONF protocols.

## Supported Protocols

The provider supports two protocols for device communication:

- **gNMI (gRPC Network Management Interface)** - Default protocol, recommended for production use
- **NETCONF** - Alternative protocol for legacy systems or specific use cases

## Device Configuration Requirements

### For gNMI (Default)

```
grpc
```

### For NETCONF

```
netconf-yang agent
 ssh
!
ssh server v2
ssh server netconf vrf default
```

All resources and data sources have been tested with the following releases.

| Platform   | Version |
| ---------- | ------- |
| XRv 9000   | 24.4.2  |
| XRd        | 24.4.2  |
| NCS 5500   | 24.4.2  |
| Cisco 8000 | 24.4.2  |

## Example Usage

### Using gNMI (Default)

```terraform
provider "iosxr" {
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
  host     = "10.1.1.1"
  protocol = "gnmi"  # Optional, gnmi is the default
}
```

### Using NETCONF

```terraform
provider "iosxr" {
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
  host     = "10.1.1.1"  # Default NETCONF port is 830
  protocol = "netconf"
}
```
